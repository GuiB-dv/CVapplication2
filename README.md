# CV application

The CV Editor is a web-based application that allows users to create, customize, and download professional resumes (CVs) in PDF format. Users can input their personal information, work experience, education, skills, and other relevant details. The app includes a real-time preview, so changes are instantly reflected, allowing for quick adjustments before exporting. Finally, users can generate a polished, well-formatted CV with a single click.
